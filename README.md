# FileToDBParser

This is a generic open source tool to parse raw data in any format, and load it into a MS SQL Server database. Alternatively, you can also output a CSV flat file.

Use this tool as a first step in your ETL data pipelines. Currently, this supports XML and JSON file formats as input. We plan to extend this support for parquet, MS Excel, CSV and other delimited flat files in the future.
